Building a portfolio website is one of the best ways to showcase your work and skills. In this post, we'll explore what makes a great portfolio site and how to build one.

## Key Elements of a Great Portfolio

### 1. Clear Navigation

Your visitors should be able to find what they're looking for quickly. Keep navigation simple and intuitive:

- **Home**: Introduction and highlights
- **About**: Your story and skills
- **Work/Projects**: Showcase your best work
- **Blog**: Share your thoughts and expertise
- **Contact**: Make it easy to reach you

### 2. Fast Performance

Performance matters. A slow-loading site creates a poor first impression. Here are some tips:

- Optimize images (use WebP format, lazy loading)
- Minimize JavaScript bundles
- Use a CDN for static assets
- Enable caching headers

### 3. Mobile-First Design

Most visitors will view your site on mobile devices. Ensure your portfolio looks great on all screen sizes:

- Use responsive design principles
- Test on real devices
- Keep touch targets large enough
- Optimize images for different viewports

### 4. Strong Visual Design

Your portfolio is a reflection of your design sensibilities:

- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Choose a color palette that reflects your brand
- Include high-quality images of your work
- Make sure text is readable with good contrast

## Building Your Portfolio

Popular options include:

- **Astro**: Great for static sites with excellent performance
- **Next.js**: Powerful React framework with many features
- **Gatsby**: Static site generator with rich plugin ecosystem
- **Hugo**: Fast, simple static site generator

### Content Strategy

Decide what to include:

1. **Hero Section**: Compelling introduction that captures attention
2. **Featured Projects**: Showcase 3-5 of your best works
3. **About Section**: Tell your story, mention your skills
4. **Blog**: Share knowledge and demonstrate expertise
5. **Contact**: Make it easy for people to reach you

### Launch Checklist
