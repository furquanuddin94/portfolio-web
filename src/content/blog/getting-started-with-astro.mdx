Astro is a modern static site generator that's gaining popularity for its performance-first approach. Unlike traditional React frameworks, Astro ships **zero JavaScript** by default, resulting in faster page loads and better Core Web Vitals.

## Why Astro?

### Performance

Astro's "islands architecture" allows you to selectively hydrate components that need interactivity, while keeping the rest of your site as static HTML. This means:

- Faster initial page loads
- Better SEO
- Lower bandwidth usage
- Improved accessibility

### Developer Experience

Astro provides an excellent developer experience with:

- **Component Islands**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML/Astro components
- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management with Markdown and MDX
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, code splitting, and more
- **Great Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive docs that make onboarding easy

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, run:

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest my-project
```

Or use npm:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-project
```

Follow the prompts to choose your template and settings. Astro will scaffold a project with sensible defaults.

## Building Your First Page

Astro uses a file-based routing system. Create a file in `src/pages/` and it automatically becomes a route:

```astro
---
// src/pages/about.astro
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>About</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore:

- [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) for managing blog posts
- [Image Optimization](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/) for better performance
- [Deploying to Vercel](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/vercel/) or other platforms

Astro makes it easy to build fast, modern websites without sacrificing developer experience. Give it a try!
