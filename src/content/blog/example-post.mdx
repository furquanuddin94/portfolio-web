## This is an example post

This post is marked as `draft: true` so it won't show up on your site.

Use this as a template when you're ready to write your first post!

### How to write a post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/content/blog/`
2. Add frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description"
publishDate: 2024-10-31
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
draft: false
---
```

3. Write your content in Markdown/MDX below the frontmatter

### You can include code blocks

```typescript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### And other Markdown features

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Links: [fukra.dev](https://fukra.dev)
- Images, headings, quotes, etc.

When you're ready to publish, set `draft: false` and the post will appear on your blog!
